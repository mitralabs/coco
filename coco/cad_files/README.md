# CAD Files

### Housing
We've been using [Fusion](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) to design the housing of coco. The [raw](raw) Files can be found in the respective Repository. 

There is a short and a long version, to account for different battery sizes.

In the [stl](stl) Folder are, as the name suggests, stl Files which can be used for 3D printing. We've been happily working with a [Bambulab Carbon X1C](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/de/products/x1-carbon) and PLA Filament. We had good results printing the standard housing with a 0.4mm nozzle. But we needed to switch to a 02.mm nozzle to print the housing with the mesh finish.

Note: The X1C is pretty good at printing in multiple colors. We used this feature to print the logo in a different color. That is why you can find individual .stl files for that.


### Building the Board
Please [contact us](mailto:coco@mitra-labs.ai), if you are interested in building the board yourself. We will happily supply you with a list of the parts needed (we might have some spare ones to give away), and instructions on how to solder/put everything together.
