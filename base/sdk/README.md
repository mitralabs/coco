# Coco Python SDK

## Installation (for development)

From **this directory** (`base/sdk`):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

(Note that this installs the package for development.
When installing this way, code changes made in this
directory are directly reflected in the package
without reinstallation. Only if new dependencies
are added to `pyproject.toml`, the installation
has to be rerun.)
