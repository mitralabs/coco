  "Strategic Thinking for Startup Success",
  "Shane Parrish:  You’ve had a remarkable journey from entrepreneur to investor, and I want to know more about this story, but I want to start with some of your early life experiences that changed you and impacted you in the future. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I was born in Taiwan to two parents who were both commercial bankers. At an early age, from what they tell me, I saw the world a little differently. I did things a little differently. The story that they like to tell about me being different is that when I was about two years old, there was a new dresser that was delivered to our apartment in Taiwan, and I figured out a way to get to the top by pulling out the first drawer, crawling into it, then pulling out the second drawer, crawling into that, and then getting all the way to the top. And when I got up there, I thought I could fly, so I jumped off. They love telling that story because they rushed me to the hospital and they were very concerned about whether there was any permanent damage and things like that. My mom kept bringing me back to the hospital again and again. And the doctor said, “Don’t worry, I think he’s fine. I think he’s fine.” And eventually she said, “Well, is there going to be any problem with his development?” He was like, “Well, either he’s going to be a genius or he’s going to be an idiot. He’s one or the other.” So that’s how my parents would describe me—high variance and high beta. And throughout school and throughout life, I was very much like that. I liked to hack things and not do the work. In elementary school, I just tried to not do the work and hack my way through things, and got suspended a few times, one of which was just for coming up with a creative idea of taking chairs from the second floor to the first floor. I went down a slide instead of following the teacher’s directions. I got suspended for that. I didn’t ever really like school all that much because it was so rigid until I used to hack my way through things.  One of the teachers that I had, Mrs. Einstein, had this way of teaching where she would put up a problem. She would then have us try to solve that problem or do the assignment and try to understand why she put the reading up there. I would always bet with her that if I knew the answer or if I knew the conclusion of the lesson, then I wouldn’t have to do the homework. And she let me get away with that once or twice. And then she said to me once, “You’re very smart. I’ve seen a lot of people waste their talent. So do you want to start first or do you want to finish first?” And I think I retorted back, saying, “Well, I’d like to start first and finish first with the least amount of work possible.” And then she said to me, “That’s a great answer for a sixth-grader, but what happens in life when there’s no finish line? What are you going to do then?” That sort of put me back and I didn’t quite understand, until maybe now, that this is the whole concept of having an infinite game and thinking through not some thing, some finish line, some goal, but just thinking about what you want your enduring impact to be and what you want to do and what you want to accomplish when the world doesn’t give you a finish line. We all have the same 24 hours in a day. What do you want to decide to accomplish in those 24 hours? We have an unknown number of years on this planet. What do you want to get accomplished? That sort of shaped the way I started thinking about the world. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Did it hit you then, at the time, or was it something you reflected on later? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think it hit me then, but I don’t think I understood it then. So that led to a number of explorations on what I did want to accomplish. Why was it important to think about this concept of infinite games? How do you win an infinite game when there are no set rules? You’re making the rules for yourself in an infinite game, and the rules change. You get to change some of the rules; the world changes some of the rules. How do you navigate that? And then you quickly realize it’s not about winning. In a finite game, chess, there’s a winner and there’s a loser. In an infinite game, there are a lot of different people in the world. They play the game differently, and in some ways they’re all trying to get on with the world and trying to do the best they can. But some people are more successful than others, and the reason they’re more successful I think is because they really know what their values are and they really know what impact they want to have on the world. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  What are your values? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Over the years I’ve thought through that, and this has changed over time, but I think the values for me are when you want to accomplish something, it’s about the inputs. It’s about the process by which you go about getting the outputs. I think it’s very, very important to have that. And I value that clarity of input, \\[which\\] eventually leads to outputs, and focusing on the inputs. I value consistent compounding and just getting up every single day and making small improvements every single day and compounding that. I value honesty and truth and just being very direct with people. I don’t try to sugarcoat anything. I value people for who they are. I learned this from my father. I was like, “Oh, okay, I’m just so much smarter than everybody else,” because I’m a cocky little kid. And he said, “Well, actually, you can learn many things from every single person on this planet.” I think I was probably six or seven at the time, and he’d show me all the different people that he learned from and said that the collection of these lessons from many, many different people is what you become. And that was a pretty important lesson. So I value people for who they are and try to learn as much as I can from each individual person. I value family and friends—pretty important to me. We talked a little bit about work-life balance. As you said, for many of us, it’s work-life integration. And if you don’t have some grounding with people who see you for who you are, who call you out when you’re not being a good person or you’re not doing the things that you said you were going to do, what is there in life besides that? ",
  "Shane Parrish:  How do you want somebody to call you out in those situations, or how do you call out other people? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The way I do it is to try to be fact-based and just give examples specifically of what has been working and what has not been working. And that tends to work pretty well. And there are times when Rebecca, my wife, will say, “Hey, this is not working for us, so what do you want to do about it?” You can try to keep going the same way down the certain path or we can try to change it. If we don’t like something, we just change it. And it’s just much easier to have those kinds of conversations. My son, a few days ago, was being quite negative about his school, and he’s 13. He’s going to be 14 this year. He’s starting to be like me when I was younger and think that he’s smarter than the whole rest of the world. And I said, “Hey, Atticus, do you want to have a negative attitude because you’ll spin into this negative spiral?” And by the way, if you have a negative attitude, the world just looks worse. When you have a positive attitude, the world just looks better. And we played this \\[game\\]: let’s use “yes/and” for a bunch of things and let’s create options, and then you’re going through the “no/but” situation and it doesn’t work. So let’s try to just change your attitude about some of these things. And I thought that was quite an interesting conversation where by simply changing the framework, he became much more positive. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  When you talk about inputs versus outputs, what inputs do you think about in life? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  It depends on what I’m trying to get accomplished, but if the inputs are just thinking about hard work, do I get up every day? If I stay healthy, do I get up every single day and work out? I hear that you work out every single day instead of trying to figure out which days you’re going to work out, because it’s always a negotiation with which days and some days you don’t feel like exercising. You just work out every day. I have the same philosophy. You just get up every single day and do the things that are important. So the inputs I have are that I get up every morning, I work out, I read through my email, and I try to think about, What’s the most important thing that I have to get right today? And I think about first-order issues. What is the first-order issue that I have to solve? What is the first-order issue of a company that needs to get fixed? What is the thing that I need to do to influence an outcome for a founder? And that’s very, very clarifying. Often we can create a very, very long to-do list, and then you’ve got to pop up a level and just look at the to-do list. What’s the most important thing I have to get accomplished? Because if you just list all the to-do’s, you probably will not be able to get to all of them. And the most important thing might be the last one you list, so you can’t just go down that list and do them one by one. Often \\[you need to pop\\] up a level, where you sort of look at the whole list and it’s like, okay, well, most of this is not important. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Is that what you mean by first-order issue? I think you mean something a little more nuanced. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Some people talk about the most important thing, and I think about first order. Say I have a problem on my hands. If I get to the first-order issue and get to the root cause of that, usually that helps solve that problem. And there are other issues that are not first order. And that concept is quite important. And we also sort of navigate that into other situations where they’re \\[facing\\] a crucible moment. As an example, you have situations where the website’s not working fast enough. At Zappos, we had a situation where the website’s not fast enough. Is the first-order issue that we have too many pictures? Well, we want the pictures. We have lots of photos. We want to show those photos. Is the first-order issue that we need to trim the number of search results? Well, customers want longer search results. No, it’s none of that. We need to figure out how to make the website go faster, so we start caching the search results. We start caching things. We start developing the technologies that solve the speed issue. But the first-order issue is that we need to solve this with technology, not with a bunch of either/or solutions. That’s an example that I learned a long time ago. Another situation: the distribution at Zappos was not flowing well and we couldn’t figure out which process was broken. Was it the picking process? Was the ordering process broken? What was broken about it? And we went and just looked through the flow, and the flow was broken. There were too many handoffs across all of these different discrete processes. We had to sort of pop up a level and figure out the flow from when a customer orders something, when it gets through the distribution center, and how it’s going to be picked, packed, and packaged and shipped. And when you look at that from a flow perspective, you start thinking about new solutions that allow there to be much better flow throughout the distribution center, rather than to batch things for picking, batch things for packing, batch things for shipping. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  That’s what you mean by first order. I want to get into more of your experience not only at Zappos, but also being on the board of or being involved with some of the companies that everybody has heard of today. Before we get there, I want to come back to the school for a second. Are there any other experiences that you had during school with teachers that might’ve impacted you? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Earlier on in junior high school, I was suspended from the computer lab because I built… This was very old, so they’re a RadioShack TRS-80; we call them Trash-80s today. And there was the computer lab; you had to rent time in our computer lab to use the computer. And I built this game. The central server at the time was literally a floppy drive where all of us saved our programs. And one day a bunch of the students in the computer lab all found the game that I programmed and then started playing with it. The teacher and the principal just happened to walk in and see that we were all playing this game, and I was told that computer lab is valuable time and you should be doing something much more productive than producing a game. So I was no longer allowed to work in the computer lab. The computer lab teacher also ran the math team, and she said, “Well, I’m sorry. The principal wants you out of the computer lab, but you should join the math team.” And I joined the math team there, and one of the things I was very good at was math. She told me that if you want to be a leader and you want the team to win, it’s not good enough for me to just solve the problems. Figure out how to get the rest of the team to perform. So I started teaching the rest of the math team some of the reasons why I was able to solve some of these problems more quickly than they were. They were very talented, but I had figured out tricks that they had not figured out. And they taught me tricks that I had not figured out. So we got better and better by riffing off each other. I learned the value of teamwork by just being thrown into a situation like that. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  You started a company before you joined Zappos. What was that? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I started a bunch of things. I started a lemonade stand when I was younger. Those were not interesting. I started a lawn mowing service in junior high school. I did it myself and realized it was not fun. It was too hot in New York City, so I got the contracts and then asked some of my friends from school if they would help me do the work. I got a few odd jobs here and there. And it was just never as fulfilling as working at a company from the ground up. When Tony Hsieh left Oracle to start this company, which was originally called Internet Marketing Solutions because they were building websites, he asked me to join that company. I said no. Then they found out that they couldn’t get anybody to go visit these websites, so he connected all of them and that became LinkExchange. And I joined that company soon after Sequoia invested in that company. It was a banner advertising exchange that was one of the largest banner advertising exchanges in 1998–’99. We sold that to Microsoft for $265 million, and that was quite the experience. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Did you know at the time we were sort of in a bubble, or how did you think about it back in the late ’90s? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I mean, we had a business. We had $15 million in revenue. You can kind of tell that we were in a bubble when someone would be willing to buy a company that had $15 million in revenue for $265 million, but also it was the third-largest acquisition at the time. I think when you’re in it, you don’t realize you’re in a bubble, but popping up, the numbers don’t make sense. That’s why I think it’s valuable to have people who are slightly outside of where you work to keep you accountable. It’s like, “Hey, how does this work?” Just by simply asking questions, you get into a situation where you’re like, “Wait, I can’t explain that question. I can’t answer that question successfully. I can’t explain it. Maybe that person’s question has more insight than I would’ve expected.” ",
  "Shane Parrish:  What are some of the lessons you learned from LinkExchange? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Boy, there were so many. There are many, many lessons because it was the first time we were doing anything that was at scale. And you hear this all the time, that you should hire slowly and make sure you really, really understand who you’re hiring for. And often when someone’s not working out, it’s probably time to let them go. And we always gave people too long. And I think the company’s velocity couldn’t go any faster because we didn’t hire as well as we could have. We didn’t let people go when they weren’t working out, and those are very, very important things to get right. I often think about the velocity of a company, and I measure that in two ways. You use the word “velocity” as opposed to “speed” because speed is just how fast you’re going, but velocity also has direction. And I think the combination of the two is quite important, but the whole speed of a company generally doesn’t get any faster unless you’re pushing. And the best companies keep pushing; otherwise, you’re just going to go slower and slower and slower. I think building a real business is really important. Many of the companies that were founded in 1998, ’99, and 2000 were not real businesses. They had lots of eyeballs, they had lots of users, but that’s not really enough, and at Sequoia we often talk about the fact that we own shares in a company. We don’t own shares in the founder. We don’t own shares in the product. We don’t own shares in their go-to-market strategy. We own shares in the company, and that company needs to have a business one day. My partner, Pat Grady, loves to say that free cash flow equals freedom, because eventually a real business generates real free cash flow. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  And the freedom being that… ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The freedom that allows you to not have to raise money, the freedom to allow you to invest in new areas, the freedom to continue to grow because you can invest in growth and invest in new novel technologies and new product lines. The freedom to not worry about the quarterly pace of having to do more and more sales. You generate free cash flow and it just generates a lot of freedom. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Let’s go back to the push-pull theme. You said companies don’t generally increase velocity without force. How do you think about the difference between adding force and removing obstacles? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  That’s very, very insightful of you. I think many times applying force is what leaders try to do, which is just to apply a forcing function and make you make a choice. And often I think removing obstacles is just as important as applying the pressure to keep going on and on and on. But often when you apply force, you realize where the obstacles are because you butt against that obstacle and then you realize, “Okay, I keep butting against this. Maybe I have to figure out a way around it.” And my job as a board member is to help you identify obstacles and help you remove them, but sometimes you just need to be pushed against them. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Is there an example that comes to mind when you say that, where you pushed and it helped you identify an obstacle? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Maybe in the early days of Airbnb. I think people forget it was much more of a listing service and it was less of a marketplace. If you take the definition of a marketplace, you have to complete the transaction. And you not only have to complete the transaction, \\[but also\\] have to remove as much friction as possible. Airbnb in the early days had a calendar, held the money, and paid out the money, but there was this big friction—big, big friction—and it was because there was not enough trust between the host and the guest. The early days of the removing of that friction was to get connected through Facebook Connect so you could check someone out and check out their Facebook pages and see who they are and see if this is an authentic person. But even that checking that out took 24, 48, 72 hours. It’s just too long and you just kept pushing. This is not going to work long term because there are only so many people that can book travel and wait 24 to 72 hours before they know that they can go there. Many great companies started out as a fringe sort of activity and you have to figure out how to make it more mainstream. Often that is about removing obstacles and removing friction, but you butt against this and you’re like, “What’s the solution here?” And you keep applying force. This is going to limit our growth if we don’t solve this. And eventually Brian and the team and the product team figured out that we needed instant booking. We needed to figure out how to instantly book people. Well, you have a whole set of hosts now that are used to not accepting guests just because they booked them. So how are you going to remove that obstacle? Well, you start with new hosts. It’s like, “Let me show you that Airbnb can be trusted. As new hosts, we’re going to send you some customers and you should just book them automatically.” And eventually more and more of the hosts realized that instant booking is just the way to go. And that’s an example where you just have to be pushed against that for a bit of time to find the solution. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Was DoorDash sort of fringe too and went mainstream? Didn’t they start in the suburbs or something? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  DoorDash started more fringe than even the suburbs. It started on a college campus, and the reason we passed on the seed round at Sequoia is that we were concerned that this was just something that college students did with their parents’ money. Then they started out focusing on Stanford and then Palo Alto and they went to other suburbs. It turned out that that was a very smart thing to do because everybody was going after the cities. One of the things that we talk about at Sequoia is that you can’t just be better; you have to be different, too. It’s easy to say and hard to implement. When everybody is chasing after the cities, because conventional wisdom tells you that that’s the right thing to do, it’s very, very hard to do something slightly different.  If you just hear Tony Xu and the team talk about their business, you realize that they had way more than just “Oh, I’m going and doing something contrarian.” They actually had real reasons why the suburbs were actually a better place to start. The value for someone who lives in the suburbs and has to drive 20 minutes to go get their food is higher than for someone who can go from their apartment, go downstairs and walk a few blocks, and get the food and bring it back home. So that was pretty interesting. The other one was, well, is there enough density around the suburbs? And it turns out, yes, there is density. You just might not think about it. They had examples where in Palo Alto, there was University Avenue and there was California Street, and in both of those places, that’s where all the restaurants were. There’s density where you can go to those restaurants and you can radiate out from there. So it was not as random as any restaurant can be anywhere and any home can be anywhere. And it turned out that when you go and look at the data, small towns all have this. There’s a reason why in small towns, there’s a Main Street where everything happens. Then you start realizing that the density problem is not as complicated as you might think. And they won because they were able to take the profits of the suburbs to go into the cities. I often think about that as there are people who think of the world and they just follow conventional wisdom, and there are people who want to be contrarian. Well, in either case, whether you want to be conventional or contrarian, you have to be right. If you’re right and conventional, it’s probably a less interesting solution, but if you’re right and contrarian, you probably won’t be able to make a lot more money because nobody’s going after that opportunity. I often find that it’s interesting. There are people who just want to be contrarian, but if you’re contrarian and wrong, that’s not a great situation. I try to put things in these two-by-two matrices of right and wrong and conventional and contrarian. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  The term I use for that is “advantageous divergence.” ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Advantageous divergence. Tell me more about that. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Well, that’s it. It’s exactly what you just said, right? It’s not enough to be contrarian. You have to be right. And so you have to diverge from the crowd, but you also have to be correct. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  It sounded like it’s kind of the Walmart strategy, where it’s like we’re going to go in this area which has less competition. We’re going to get really good at what we do, and then we’re going to use the money or profits and we’re going to funnel them into maybe the more desirable area. When Walmart started competing with Sears, they didn’t go into cities \\[like\\] Kmart. They went into the suburbs where nobody was. Or the contrast, I think, between their ability and what they were competing against was much higher. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  And I think that that’s what all startups should focus on. You don’t want to compete with someone bigger than you head on because they have more money, they have more people, and they have more history. Wherever they have more abilities, you just want to compete with them where they’re not competing. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Double-click on that for me. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Well, your example about Walmart; the example about DoorDash focusing on the suburbs. There’s an example about DoorDash—do you want to win McDonald’s or do you want to win the top 100 merchants? And it’s not just about one or two. Yes, McDonald’s is one of the largest merchants, but winning a whole suite of them is actually more valuable. Google, the long tail, keywords more valuable than the head. Most of advertising was broadcast advertising—you start from the top—and this is a bunch of long-tail keywords. And I think a lot of great companies, whether it’s intentional or not, try to do things very differently than what exists today. Apple wasn’t the first to do many things. They didn’t make the first personal computer. Their focus was always about the user experience, whether it was the computer, the phone, or the watch. Everything they do is about having a great user experience. That was not the conventional thing that people thought about. In the early days of the PC, it was about processing speed and which processor was the fastest, etc., etc. When the phone came out, it was about the keyboard. We don’t use the keyboard anymore. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  The Apple thing is fascinating. So was the BlackBerry thing because they really hung onto that keyboard thing, but I remember when they came out with their new… I forget what the device was called; it was like their Apple killer. I used it as a demo and I couldn’t figure out how to get on the internet, and I was like, “They’re done.” ",
  "Alfred Lin:  User experience is so important. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  It took a demo to figure out how to use the internet. Once you figured it out, it was great, but I was like, “Oh man, this is so not intuitive.”  Let’s go back to hiring and firing a little bit. Were there any moments at Zappos or earlier with LinkExchange where you thought you had the wrong fit, but it turned around? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  That’s a great way of asking that question. I would say probably not. In the early days of LinkExchange, back to conventional, we hired the conventional right person. We were looking for a marketing person. We were looking for a marketing person that marketed to small and medium-sized businesses. They understood the internet and they fit all the specs that you would have in a job description, but they didn’t fit the way we operated. They didn’t fit what we valued, and it’s easy to limit that down to they’re just a professional marketer and they’re a mercenary, not a missionary. That’s how Tony would tell the story. But at the end of the day, they didn’t value what we were trying to build. They didn’t have the same values that we had.  This is why when Zappos started, Tony—this is Tony Hsieh of LinkExchange and Zappos—spent a lot of time defining the values of the company. And it’s something that I talk to founders about. If you don’t have the same mission, you don’t have the same values, and you don’t have the same operating understanding of the company, it’s very, very hard to work together. And then you’re asking someone to change when they fundamentally don’t fit the company and how the company works. That is generally the issue. Then the other issue on the flip side, on the functional side, is when your company is growing really, really fast and you see someone who is growing, but they’re not growing as fast as the company. Every single day, the delta between how far the company is moving or how fast the company is moving versus how fast or how far the person is moving gets bigger and bigger and bigger. So it gets very hard to turn around.  We have this concept that a lot of people have. At Sequoia, we hire for slope, not intercept. Experience obviously matters, but if you just hire for the experience and their slope is not fast, that’s going to become a problem at some point. So we really, really ask founders to think about, What is the person’s potential? What is their slope? And we’d much rather bet on someone with high slope and low intercept because in startups, in companies that are new, the experience is helpful, but you’re doing something different and new and you need to reinvent. Bringing a playbook over from somewhere else is helpful up to a degree, but usually many of the problems that you need to solve are just different. That’s why you hear a lot of founders talk about first-principles thinking and “don’t reason by analogy,” etc. because you do have to solve the problem a different way. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  What’s the difference between slope and potential? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Well, they’re pretty much the same thing, slope and potential, but slope is having a high rate of learning, a high rate of being able to move fast. If someone has a lot of potential, they’re over here. Their potential is up here. That slope when you draw that line is pretty high. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  How do you gauge somebody’s potential? It’s like they might be able to do this job and they might be able to grow into it, but coming into it, they’re not going to check the boxes. They’re going to look different. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The future does not look like the past, but you have nothing else to go on but the past, and you can see whether someone moved really, really quickly in the previous situation where they were promoted three times in the same year at a different company that was moving very, very quickly. Do they have a sense of urgency? You can test for some of these things. You can ask about these things, but yeah, you don’t know whether they have the potential to grow into the next stage of the company until you put them in that position. Often, I think the challenge is that the company is moving so fast and you’re hiring someone that has done the job before and you know that they can do the job for the next year or two, and that’s maybe good enough. If you hire someone and you have to let them go in three months, that was a mis-hire. There’s almost no reason why that person was not going to be able to do the job for three months. They either were not a cultural fit or didn’t have the right skills. If they stick around for a year or two, it’s usually because they’ve done the job before and they’re picking up a bunch of low-hanging fruit. But I look at Tony Xu at DoorDash. Many of the people who work for him have worked for him for a long period of time. He likes to grow people from within. He obviously hires from outside as well, but many of the people who’ve been around the company have been around for a long time. At Amazon, many of the senior VPs that were around Bezos had been around the company for a long, long time. Now that Andy Jassy’s there now, as CEO, he’s trying to develop people also for a long period of time. If you look at great companies, they’re very, very good at both developing talent from within and hiring from outside. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Is it a red flag if the turnover is too high then? Is it a sign that people don’t know how to hire right? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think it’s a red flag and you look at it and you don’t want to… So the issue with metrics is that people start managing to the metrics. If you start telling them, “Hey, your turnover is really high,” they start managing to the turnover number. And that’s another thing; you have to manage the rate of regrettable turnover. What is regrettable turnover? Why are you not able to retain your best people? And if you have unregrettable turnover, then why did you hire these people in the first place? If you break the problem down that way, you can find out what the issue is with turnover. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  I really like thinking about it in terms of regrettable versus unregrettable turnover. A lot of people, when they’re hiring, are thinking, “We need this job. I want to know somebody who’s done it at the next level because that’s where we’re growing to,” so they’re trying to anticipate where they’re growing. One of the problems that I hear commonly is that that person might’ve done 100 million to 300 million growth, but they had a different team than we have. They have a different system, different resources. How do you think about that when it comes to hiring? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  My observation is that when you try to hire someone that is from a company that is one chapter or two chapters ahead, they tend to work out better, and part of that is because they’re only one or two chapters ahead of you. If you try to hire someone who’s 10 chapters ahead, that usually is a problem because you don’t know whether they understand the problem that’s a few chapters before. It’s too far away. On your particular point about the system, I do think that if you hire people who are 10 chapters ahead and they have a whole system in place, even though they took it from 100 to 300 in a product division inside of a large, large company, they probably had a lot of guardrails that allowed them to not make a bunch of mistakes. So you have to dissect whether that operating system works the same way as your operating system. Most startups don’t have an operating system, so the thing that you have to assess is, How well can this person operate when it’s just more nebulous and it’s just less clear? Are they going to put the operating system in place? ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Dive into this story behind Zappos from the initial idea in the early days, just a high-level five-minute version, to the exit with Amazon. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Maybe from the start, Zappos was this weird idea. I can’t even believe we funded it. It was originally founded by Nick Swinmurn. He had called and left a message on our answering machine. This was in 1999. Tony Hsieh and I were running a seed fund, a venture fund, an incubator called Venture Frogs. And Nick said, “Hey, I have this crazy idea. I’m a webmaster at Autobytel,” which is an auto website. “I’m the webmaster there. I think it’d be great to just start something for shoes because I went to one store. I couldn’t find the right size, went to another store, couldn’t find the right color, and went to another store; they didn’t even have the style that I’m looking at.” And he had already searched the web and found a whole bunch of websites where people were basically trying to sell specific shoes on the internet.  We thought it was the craziest idea and we almost… I think one of us had our finger on the Delete button for that voicemail, and then he said, “You might think this is crazy, but mail order is already 5% of sales in the US for shoes.” I’m like, okay, 5% is still small, but the shoe industry is $40 billion, and 5% is $2 billion, and it wasn’t rocket science to understand that the internet was going to be bigger than mail order. So we took a meeting. We decided to make an investment and we funded the company $500,000 at a time when we were at Venture Frogs. I had to then leave to go work at a company called Tellme Networks, and Tony joined Zappos relatively early on as an advisor and then became co-CEO and eventually CEO. The most important thing back then was that as an e-commerce company, from 1999 to 2000, it was growing. In 2001, I was like, “Uh-oh, we have a situation.” The day after 9/11, the company had zero in sales. Zero. We went from whatever it was, which was small, to zero, and that was the first crucible moment. I’m using the term because Sequoia uses the term “crucible.” What are we going to do about that? It shook the company, and we went back to basics and wanted to build a company that was profitable.  Tony ran the company at breakeven and continued to grow the company for a long period of time until Sequoia came in in 2004, 2005 to make the first investment. Most of the company was financed from a small seed round. Tony invested $10 million of his own money, but most of it was financed through being very creative, figuring out how to get merchants that we ordered from to give us credit and to increase the credit line. We eventually got a line of credit from Wells Fargo, but the company burned very little cash. And for a company that went from zero to, when we sold the company, $1.6 billion in sales, \\[the fact\\] that it really didn’t have a lot of equity financing was pretty incredible. You hear about companies raising hundreds of billions of dollars to get to $1.6 billion in GMV (gross merchandise value) or in sales, and here’s a company that basically raised $10 million. And it probably was undercapitalized, but it really did highlight that you can build a company by having CAC (customer acquisition cost) be profitable on the first order, by being focused on customer service and not focused on marketing. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Talk to me a little bit more about that because you didn’t have a huge budget for marketing. Within the first month, you basically had to pay yourself back from marketing. How do you think about that, not only back then, and then what’s different now in a world where there’s a lot more money and maybe all the players aren’t rational about how they’re spending money to grow? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Back then, we probably thought it was a curse that we couldn’t raise more money because you probably would rather run the business a little bit looser so we could grow a little faster. But being tight led us to find solutions that were, again, non-obvious or divergent, to use your term. And the divergent idea we had was that if we can only spend money that was profitable on the first order, we needed other ways to grow, and the focus was to become much better at customer service. We noticed that it was much easier to keep a customer and get that customer to order more than it was to acquire a new customer. Then we just went down the line of “What we can do for the customer?” We tried to make the website load as quickly as possible. We tried to pick, pack, and ship within four hours. The solution to “pick, pack, and ship in four hours” was to solve an operations flow issue and not batch the operations, which I don’t think anybody else figured out in e-commerce back then besides Amazon. We decided to work very, very closely with UPS in particular, and then FedEx and USPS, to figure out how to get the shipping rates as low as possible. We started shipping so that it was five to seven days ground shipping to eventually overnight shipping so that the customer got it the next day. We figured out reverse logistics, so we’re bringing the shoes to your home. We heard lots of reasons why people didn’t want to order shoes on the internet. We knew that before we invested, and we knew that we needed to bring the store to your home—have you try on and then return the things that didn’t work for you, that you did not want anymore. And by doing all those things, we provide much better customer service. On any given day, 80% of the orders we had were from repeat customers. We grew the business some with marketing, but the majority by providing great customer service, having high repeat rates, having high LTV (lifetime value), and having customers basically tell everybody else how great that business was, how well they were treated, etc., etc. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  I read somewhere, and this was counterintuitive when I came across it, so correct me if I’m wrong, that your best customers returned the most shoes. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah, that was a very contentious discussion because every year, the return rate would go slightly higher and slightly higher, but we kept growing. One way to look at it is that it’s not really hurting us. The other way is that the return rates are high, and the most expensive process in the distribution center is managing the returns. You have the return shipping. You have to open up the boxes. You have to look at the product and figure out whether it’s ready to go back on the shelf, it’s damaged and I need to fix it, or it can no longer be sold again because if you put something that cannot be sold to me again on the website and make it available and that gets ordered, it’s freaking going to come back and be returned again. We then did this analysis, and this is the type of analysis I really enjoy doing. I was like, “Let’s take our best customers and let’s take our worst customers and look at their return rates,” and it turned out that our best customers, with the highest LTVs, returned the most. And I’m like, “That is crazy. How is that possible?” Well, it turns out that because they understood how to use Zappos, they just ordered more. Yes, they returned more, but they kept more, too, because they would be willing to try things. If you never return anything, that means the only things you buy are the things that you’re super comfortable with. You know the size; you know the style. We were trying to help people open up the aperture, try new things, so we did this analysis on the extremes and compared them and realized that our best customers had the highest return rate.  So then you say, well, the board doesn’t like the fact that we have such an expensive return policy and it’s costing us a bunch of money. Then the solution is not to reduce the return policy and make it less liberal. You want to keep the return policy as liberal as you can, but make the cost of processing as low as possible. Going back to the first-order issue, the first-order issue is not the return rate. The first-order issue is making the return process as cheap and efficient as possible. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  It’s so counterintuitive when you think about it because you actually are like no, we’re okay with people returning shoes as long as they’re buying more and then they’re trying them on at home, which is exactly what we want and sending back what doesn’t work. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think we changed the whole industry, and it originally was just a competitive response. We had a liberal return policy of 30 days. Other people copy 30 days. Then it was 90 days. Other people copy 90 days. And then we made it 365 days, and not everybody can copy that. Some did, but by doing that, it put a stake in the ground that we want people to try the Zappos experience and have a great experience. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Why do you think it works for shoes, but doesn’t seem to get as much traction when it comes to clothing? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  No, I think it got a lot of traction for clothing. It was an understood problem by the time we got into clothing that you wanted to have high returns. You’re going to have high returns, and therefore, you need better processing for clothing. I think for clothing, for shoes, and for a variety of soft goods, return rates are high because you need to try them on and try them out. I’d also point out that in shoes, the difference in sizing really does matter. I mean, you wear a small or a medium \\[in clothing\\]. Both could probably fit, and you may look more buff when you wear small, and it’s loose fitting when it’s a medium or whatever size you want to use. But for shoes, the difference between 7 and 7.5 or between 12 and 12.5 is a big difference. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  I was never a Zappos customer, so sorry, but did you do things where it’s like, “Hey, last time you were ordering a 10.5 or 11; last time, you ordered a 10; we’re just letting you know as an effort to reduce returns that maybe you hit the wrong button”? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  We let people know those things. We also let them know that you’re used to buying this brand, like ASICS running shoes, and Nike fits a little looser, so you might want to \\[change\\] the size. We had this measure of “Does this fit true to size or does it fit a little looser, a little tighter?” ",
  "Shane Parrish:  You guys also had an incredibly unique culture. What went into the thinking behind that? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The culture of Zappos was very special, and it was something that we wanted to preserve, partly because Tony Hsieh had this experience at LinkExchange where we didn’t define the values of the company. We started hiring people that were conventionally right for the positions in the job. And one day, he woke up and realized that the company that he had founded and built was no longer the company he wanted to work at, and he wanted to make sure that the company that had this special culture, that was Zappos, kept the culture. In the early days, it was not very well defined. What is the culture of Zappos? Well, that was more nebulous in the early days, and then the company grew and people asked, “What is the culture?” “We don’t have it written down.” “How do you know someone’s a culture fit?” “Well, does Tony like them? Does Fred like them? Does Alfred like them after the interview?” And I don’t like the word “like.” “Like” could mean so many different things. It was just not well defined.  At some point, Tony decided to just ask the company, “What do you think the values of Zappos are? What are your personal values, and what do you not like about Zappos?” And just parsing through that, we got a lot of responses. And in his book *Delivering Happiness*, he talks about the fact that we started with 38 different values that were all Zappos values and combined them, shrunk them. We ended up with 10 core values. The problem with 10 is that there are probably a handful of people that remember all 10. Most people remember the first one or two or three of them, and the first one was to deliver well through service. It was in some sense the most important core value, but we meant it in a way not just to deliver well through service to customers, but also to employees, to our business partners, and to investors. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  You had a different management system as well. Talk to me about that. Was it holistic management? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Holacracy. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Holacracy. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Holacracy, yeah. The management philosophy was different, partly because we wanted to hire people that could just self-run and self-sustain. There was an element of allowing people to do what they love the most and pair them with other people who love other things and make it sort of homegrown. I think Tony’s perception of his job was that his idea of creating an operating system for the company was to basically build a greenhouse—that was his analogy—and he’s going to try to help every single person grow as tall and as strong as possible. So he very much focused on allowing people to focus on their strengths and hire other people for their weaknesses to supplement that. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Is there an ideal growth rate, do you think? Can you grow too fast? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The answer depends. If you’re growing so fast that the customer experience starts to degrade, you’re hurting yourself. So yes, you can grow so fast that it’s just a complete mess. You’re losing customers because you’re not servicing them correctly. At Zappos, we were very mindful that whatever customer experience we delivered, it was the best customer experience we could deliver at that growth rate. And I think if you ask Tony Xu at DoorDash or Brian Chesky at Airbnb, they would probably say the same thing. It’s like, we want to grow as fast as possible with the constraint that we want to make sure that there’s a great customer experience. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  And maintain the internal culture? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah. And maintaining the internal culture is one way of thinking about it, and you may have to grow the culture over time. You have a company; it’s growing. Do you think the culture that was there on day one is going to be the culture that’s going to work 5 years or 10 years in? ",
  "Shane Parrish:  It’s not this static thing. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  It’s not a static thing. Cultures should not be static. Every year, you do a strategic plan and a financial plan. You figure out what your next year’s revenue is going to be. Your hiring plan, your marketing plan—you have all these plans. You should also have a plan for culture and how to grow that. I think the best companies think about that. How does our company change? How do we grow up? How do we become one year older and better and faster at the same time? ",
  "Shane Parrish:  How, when you’re having so much success scaling, going from a million dollars in sales to a billion, do you not get complacent? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think that… ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Because you were dominating the market at that point in time. You were the leader clearly in that space. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  You’re talking about Zappos or… ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Yeah. Well, in general. Either. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  In general, I think for every company, if you read Jim Collins’s book, *Why the Mighty Fall*, the first sign is the hubris of much success. At Sequoia, we’re just never complacent. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  But you actively work not to be complacent. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  We actively work not to be complacent at almost every single company to make sure that you’re not complacent. Successful companies just think that way. At Sequoia, we talk about \\[the idea that\\] you’re only as good as your next investment. At Zappos, we talked a lot about how easy it is to ruin a good reputation. The next order, if that’s not good for a customer, you’ve built all this effort to build a good reputation with a customer, and there’s one bad order on an important order like \\[something for\\] their wedding day and you ruin that reputation. I think a lot of companies have different ways of thinking about that. And Brian Chesky thinks about “What’s the next thing?” What’s the transformation that we’re going to create? What is the next thing for the customer experience that’s going to be great? Tony Xu thinks about the next product to power the local economies. What’s the next set of people that we’re going to help? And I think if you go back in the history of any business, you notice that customers are just enormously impatient and they’re enormously unsatisfied. Everything that is new and novel becomes standard. And Bezos has this line about how customers are just always, always dissatisfied. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  I want to go deeper on that. It’s almost like there’s a natural entropy to create more sediment inside an organization. Tobi Lütke used the word “sediment.” You start building up the bureaucracy and entropy, like that’s the natural result of growth and scale, and then you actually have to apply a lot of energy to make sure that it doesn’t happen. What are the early signs that you see that… ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Of sediment? Well, there are a lot of examples of this. I always take a snapshot when I go into a company for the first time to see how fast they’re moving. Then I tell them, “Today is a great day. Hopefully, you will move faster than today.” And I hold that as a bar. If you don’t have that mentality, it will start to slow down. So what’s the sediment? Instead of making good, fast decisions, the thing that people value is having a good process that slows you down to make sure you have the right decision. You have to make high-velocity decisions at scale, and I look for that. Are we able to make high-quality fast decisions as quickly as possible, or do you let the process determine the decision? ",
  "Shane Parrish:  How do you judge a decision’s quality? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  You can’t necessarily at the moment in time. You can think about things at the moment in time as, How reasoned, how deeply have you thought about the problem? How much research have you done? And you can at least say, well, you researched the problem. You understood it deeply and you’ve picked a course, and hopefully that’s the right decision. In hindsight, you can always look back and look at whether those decisions were right or wrong, and I don’t think enough companies look at that enough. Instead of \\[just\\] projecting next year’s revenue and next year’s strategic plan, part of the strategic plan should be about looking backwards. What decisions did you get right? What decisions did you get wrong? Where do we need to course-correct? ",
  "Shane Parrish:  You guys also had an element of, I think it was even specific back before it became popular, but getting 1% better. Talk to me a little bit about that—what it meant practically speaking. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  There were two things at Zappos that I pushed very hard and popularized. One was the power of “and” because I found too many people trying to figure out ways to do “either/or.” It wasn’t like, “Okay, we’re going to ship product more quickly, but the website’s going to be slower.” You’ve got to do both. And if you think about the little things that we do at Zappos, it was about just compounding 1% every single day. I used to write on the whiteboard 1 plus 1% to the 365 because if you take a dollar and compound it 1% every single day, you get this ridiculous result, which is $38. When I hear about making a leap forward, 1 to 38 is a big leap, and it’s on a scale of figuring out what’s a 10X idea. It’s even bigger than a 10X idea. I hear founders talk all the time about, “I only want 10X ideas because those are the things that move the needle.” And it turns out that simply compounding 1% every single day moves the needle even more than a 10X idea does. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Where do people tend to go astray? You have a great core product, and I’m just imagining that you start building up a team. You start getting out of your focus. Where do companies go wrong? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  A number of places. If you just look at great companies, they compound at a very high rate for a long period of time in their core business. Google for a long period of time was search. Amazon for a long period of time was e-commerce. I think there’s a difference between Act 2 and category expansion. So at Amazon, they went from books to music to electronics to a whole bunch of \\[other stuff\\]. They just went category by category, but it was the same real core business, which is getting product to the distribution center, picking and packing the products that you want, and shipping them to you. It could be books, it could be music, it could be electronics, it could be shoes, it could be tools, it could be a hammer, but that’s one core business.  I think founders start their companies because they have novel and compelling insights into the world and specifically for their companies, and they like the new shiny penny. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t focus on the new shiny penny that is adjacent to your business. I’m just saying that you shouldn’t focus on the new shiny penny that is way out away from your business.  Eventually, all companies need an Act 2. AWS (Amazon Web Services) was an Act 2. That was very different from the e-commerce business, but even the way that Amazon thought about their web services business was like, “Well, we’re very good at building distribution centers. Originally the distribution center that we built was for physical things, and here, we’re building a distribution center for electronic things, for bits.” Even the way to think about it was quite interesting. They didn’t think this was a high-margin business. They thought of it as, “Okay, this will be a low-margin business, too, and we like low-margin businesses.” ",
  "Shane Parrish:  That was Bezos’s famous quote, right? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Your margin is my opportunity. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  I like the idea of Act 2. For a lot of companies, Act 2 happens when the founder steps down and professional management comes in. Talk to me about the difference between, as you see it, a founder-led company and a professionally led company. And I use the word “professionally” loosely because founders are professionals, but I just want people to get the distinction in their heads. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Well, there’s a lot being said about the difference between founder mode and manager mode, and I would go back to the question, Should it be “and”? Don’t you want to be both? I have a concept of fire and ice. The best companies have both this huge fire—they have this entrepreneurial spirit and they run hot because the idea is so compelling and interesting—and this icy side. It’s just cold facts. It’s management. It’s about getting to the details. The best companies have both, and it pains me to see that you have to choose one or the other because the best companies figure out how to make sure that both are in the company. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  What are the different strengths, I guess, then—maybe that’s a better way to think of this question—between founder mode and management mode? What are the weaknesses and strengths of each? How do they work symbiotically together? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I would say that there are many different modes of a founder or a manager. In the beginning days, you’re a creator. You’re finding zero to one. You’re creating something that the world has not seen before, and the mode there is to be a creator and instead of calling yourself a founder, you’re creating something that the world has never seen.  Once you create that, sometimes it gets into operator mode, and many founders are fine operating and making their creations better. It’s about understanding the inputs and outputs. How do I make the system better? I create something. I need to go to market with it. How do I systematically make the go-to-market happen? And you’re trying to just operate the thing in a way that sort of scales the business. And many founders are very, very good at the scaling.  Then you get to a mode where you need to manage, where you’re trying to figure out resources and resource allocation—Should I invest a dollar in the core business or should I invest that dollar in a new project?—and having a framework for how to make management decisions like that. That’s what a lot of companies at scale need the CEO to figure out.  And then there’s just a level of leadership around how you lead the organization and think about it from an organizational standpoint. So some of that is manager mode and some of that is founder mode, but let’s just break it down to what it is and not talk about one contrast over the other. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Well, I want to go back to something you said earlier about crucible moments. What are they and how do you identify them? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  “Crucible moments” is the term we use at Sequoia for things that are basically very important Type 1 decisions. As an operator before Sequoia, I didn’t call them crucible moments, but I’ve gone through a fair share of crucible moments. With LinkExchange, do we want to sell the company to Microsoft? At Tellme Networks, when we’re burning $60 million a quarter, how do we get through that and how do we pivot the company from a consumer business that wasn’t working into an enterprise business? These are decisions that change the trajectory of a company. At Zappos, it was, What do we do after 9/11 when sales went to zero? What do we do during the financial crisis when credit became very, very difficult and we were borrowing $60 million? And we had $60 million of debt. We did nothing wrong, but the banks didn’t have the liquidity anymore. They were calling the loan. How do you go through these things? At Airbnb there have been a number of crucible moments as well, one of which started very early on that Brian Chesky talks about a lot, which was the PR crisis with a guest trashing a host. That led to host guarantees, but there were many of those moments. There was a fight to win Europe and a competitor called Wimdu that copied the Airbnb website pixel by pixel. Or DoorDash’s decision to go after suburbs and not the cities. They didn’t forego the cities, but they were going to start with suburbs first. DoorDash’s decision to focus on merchants and selection over speed: You can have a situation where you can increase speed of delivery by just having a smaller radius, so if I only show you the restaurants that are close to your home, you’ll get your deliveries faster, but it doesn’t give you the breadth of selection that you may want. These decisions change the trajectory of the company, and those choices many times are one-way doors. Once you make that decision, you can’t go back. I think they’re very, very important to get right. At Sequoia, we have a podcast about it partly because we want to highlight how founders and the management teams puzzle through these decisions. And then another characteristic of crucible moments is that every one of them doesn’t look like the other, so you’re presented with a new problem and you’re trying to figure that out for first principles, how to solve that problem. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  That’s the second or third time you’ve brought up first-principles thinking. What does that mean? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  For me it means you start from a blank sheet of paper and you have a bunch of frameworks that help you sort of triangulate the answer. Throw those out. Maybe you need a new framework for this particular situation. You’re the king of mental models. To me, they’re frameworks. We love them because they instantly help us think about the world and narrow down the options. In some situations, you want to generate more options and more ideas, and in those particular situations, you don’t want to narrow your thinking; you want to broaden your thinking. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  If we’re on a board together and we get a problem, how do you think through that in first-principles thinking? How would you do that in that setting? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I’ll give you an example from Airbnb. When the pandemic hit, you could decide to do a variety of things. There are all these pressures. There are the investors who want you to raise enough capital so that you can go through and weather the storm. There are employees that want to know that they’re going to be employed. There are hosts that want to know that even though guests can’t travel, they have a non-refundable cancellation policy, so they’re going to get the money. You have guests who want to figure out how to get their money back because they’re not traveling. You have a business that went from a business that was growing 20, 30, 40% a year to a business that declines and you lose 80% of your revenue. There are all these pressures. It’s a complete mess. And the solution that you had yesterday doesn’t work for today because Airbnb before the pandemic, there was a lot of cross-border travel. And today, after the pandemic \\[starts\\], there is no cross-border travel. How do you think about this problem? Where do you start? Well, it’s a mess. Everybody’s yelling at you from all these different angles, and one of the most important things is to stay calm and look at the problem that we have at hand and figure out what the most important problems are to solve first, second, and third. And Brian had principles that he had outlined. We used to have these emergency board meetings and it was just always discussing \\[whatever the emergency is\\] this week, this week, this week.  Then he leveled up and decided to say, “Hey, we need principles to decide what we’re going to do.” And he decided that we have a once-in-a-generation pandemic, one in a hundred years. Outside the building, there’s nothing that he can do to fix the pandemic, but what he can do is to make sure that Airbnb survives for the next generation. And he had principles by which he wanted to make sure that when we get out of this, we’re seen as someone who created Airbnb for the next generation and not something that wasn’t going to survive this generation.  Then he went to work. And he had these great plans to reduce our burn by doing all the things in this order. We’re going to cut marketing. Nobody’s traveling anyway. Easy decision. We’re going to cut contractors. We don’t have enough work for them. Easy decision. We’re going to have to raise money and we’re going to do it in a way that doesn’t burden previous investors. So we’re not going to raise money in a low valuation. We’re going to raise debt. Why do we need to raise the money? To survive this crazy situation where both the guests and the hosts want their money back. We have $3 billion of capital on the balance sheet of Airbnb, but we have $3 billion or $4 billion of customer deposits. We can give all of that to one side, and one side will be pissed at us. Give it all to the hosts; the guests will be pissed. If we give it to the guests, the hosts will be pissed. And we won’t have a business when we emerge from the pandemic. So he goes out and raises $4 billion. There’s $2 billion of debt. So two plus three is five. We can cover both sides. Okay. We can pay both sides. Instead of paying it out, why don’t you just calm down? You’ll get this money, you know you can get this money, and let’s see how the system works itself out. So he had to sort of project confidence and imagine his way out of this thing. And you imagine a solution, which is, okay, we’re in New York City right now. Not a lot of people want to stay in their apartments in New York; they’re traveling upstate. In San Francisco, where I was, not a lot of people wanted to be in San Francisco. They went to Napa. So slowly but surely, it didn’t happen in March, it didn’t happen in April, but in May, you found resilience in the business model where people started to travel again just in their own backyards, in their own country. And that allowed the company to come out of that.  And the thing that he did last was to lay off employees. He knew that the employees were going to have a harder time finding another job during that time, during the pandemic. And so you just had these principles of how he’s going to go solve this problem. Nobody would’ve told him to do that in that order. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  That’s an incredible example. Thank you. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  And then on the flip side, this is the craziest thing because Airbnb was the poster child of the number-one IPO possibility for 2020 and they had seen their revenue go down 80%. And then they came out of that and went on to be the number-one IPO of that year in December. And with DoorDash, I had the opposite experience, which was, boy, they were also trying to go public that year, but instead of being beaten down by the pandemic, they really accelerated during the pandemic. Also, Tony Xu had a lot of principles behind what he wanted to get accomplished. And it was like anything else during the beginning of the pandemic. It was very, very scary because around the world, there were some places that were completely shut down, including restaurants, and if you shut the restaurants down, because of his experience having worked in a restaurant with his mom, by his mom’s side, washing dishes with his mom, he knew that restaurants wouldn’t survive. They had less than 30 days of cash. And that’s less than 30 days of cash when they actually are running at full speed. So now they have less cash. The restaurant is shut down for a period of time; people didn’t know whether they could order food and it would be okay. As soon as we figured out that the restaurants shouldn’t be shut down and the restaurants could remain open for delivery and takeout, he went to full force on making sure that the business could help merchants bridge the gap. This is not something that other companies couldn’t have done, but one of the things I really respect about Tony and the team is that they decided that these merchants were going to be hurting and we needed to help them. So they proactively went out and uploaded menus from different merchants onto DoorDash and said, “Hey, I know you guys are hurting. The only thing you can do is delivery. We’re here to help you. We’ve uploaded the menu, your menu, we found your menu, whether it’s on the internet or we’ve got a copy of your menu, we’ve uploaded it or it’s ready to go. Just let us know if we can turn it on for you.” And that allowed DoorDash to grow very, very quickly during the pandemic. I thought that DoorDash was a well-run company in 2019, and it was a process by which they grew very fast. They probably grew too quickly. Their unit economics weren’t great. They had a few hard fundraising rounds for the C and D \\[funding series\\]. They fixed the unit economics. So in 2019 it was a well-oiled machine, and I saw this well-oiled machine pushed to another level in 2020 during the pandemic when they really did help restaurants when they were in a world of hurt. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  So the pandemic is a crucible moment for every business. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  It was a crucible moment for every business. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  What differentiated the founders in Sequoia who took advantage of that opportunity and came out of it stronger from the ones who didn’t? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I hate to say this and it may be trite, but going through the pandemic, we all came out stronger. It was a shared experience. Sometimes when you go through crucible moments and crises, you don’t have the shared experience. But to answer your question more succinctly, there were people who knew that the crisis was an opportunity. And then there were those who just thought of it as a crisis, and I think it was Andy Grove that said that good companies get better and they’re defined by a crisis, whereas there are a lot of companies that are destroyed by a crisis. And many great companies were defined and they changed the way they did things. They found solutions that you would not have imagined if the crisis hadn’t happened. And I think the founders realize they’re in a crucible moment. They realize they need to do something differently and they stay calm. They stop. They look around 360 degrees and say, “That’s the direction I’m going.” Even though the whole world is revolving around them and it’s a complete whirlwind, they imagine why they should go in that direction. And in most cases, they had to find a different solution, a different product, a different way of operating, and then scale down into that direction. Those are the ones that come out really, really successful.  In Airbnb’s case, they had to change cross-border travel to local travel. They changed to long-term stays; they changed to having experiences. In DoorDash’s case, they simply had to do things that they’d never done before. It wasn’t a product change, but they had to imagine a different solution. They were not going to wait until merchants call them and say, “Let’s negotiate a deal.” They said, “Look, we’ve uploaded your menus onto the website, into our app. These are our standard terms. Do you want to go or not?” That wasn’t a product that they had designed before the pandemic.  Often you need to find a completely different solution. I mean, they seem so simple after the fact, but at that moment, it is completely unclear that that was the right decision. But that’s why you need to stay calm. That’s why you need to look around. You need to stop, look around, and find the right direction that you want to go in and then accelerate. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  I think that’s really an interesting approach, right? Where you sort of stop, you don’t panic, and you evaluate what’s going on as rationally as you can in the moment despite everybody wanting things from you and all this pressure that you probably have from investors, but you also put on yourself to take care of your employees, take care of your customers, and take care of your family. And everybody’s worried about the same thing, so you’re operating in a very amplified environment to begin with. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The best founders are doing this day to day, but here the time frames are much, much shorter and much, much more compressed and people’s voices are much louder. Just recently, Tony said that it’s about many good decisions about sequencing. We all know what we need to do, but sequencing it right is actually what matters. And the sequence of how you do something often determines whether you’re remembered or not remembered. In the example that we talked about for Airbnb, there was a sequence \\[that started by asking\\], What are the values that I have for the company? And let’s go through the sequence that most matches the values. Brian wanted to take care of the employees the most, so the layoff was the last thing that he did. He tried to do everything else before the layoff. In Tony’s case, because he had a heart for merchants, the sequence was to take care of merchants. When you have these well-understood values, it makes the sequencing a lot easier. And often people forget. They write down their values for a good reason because when you don’t have a playbook anymore, all you have left is the essence of what the company is, which is the values of the company. Often that’s the essence of the founder, the values of that founder and how they want to operate. But you forget that because it’s noisy, and there are lots of people, lots of different parties wanting your time and your attention. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Working from home has become a somewhat contentious topic, but I really want to hear your thoughts on the pros and cons and how you see it. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Pros and cons. I think it’s very, very hard to build an early-stage company remotely. And the reason I say that is that unless you’ve worked with each other before, \\[it’s harder to build trust\\]. I view there to be a well of trust that is created when you work together. The reason why people who have worked together for a long period of time can anticipate each other’s movements and what they’re going to do next is because they’ve been around each other for a long time. And as you know, most of our communication is not verbal; there’s body language and how you sit, how you react. There’s a lot of communication that we miss through working from home. And you just can’t read it as well on the screen versus in person because on screen in Zoom you only see your head. There’s the rest of your body that you don’t see. So I think it’s quite important for early-stage teams to work together. I mean, they don’t have an office; they find the coffee shop to work together at. Why do you do that? You can all work from home, but why do you get together at a coffee shop to work together? It’s noisy. They have a lot of people around. There’s a reason why you want to do some of these things. Does it mean that every single day I’m more productive in the office? No. There are days when I’m writing a memo; it’s probably better if I sit in the office or I’m at home and just cranking. It’s also hard, very, very hard, to build culture if you’re all separate and apart from each other. There’s no ritual. Culture is the \\[set of\\] values, but how do you express those values? They’re your behaviors. They’re the rituals, they’re the narratives that we tell each other, and those things are just a lot harder to do over Zoom.  I think all companies should go back to being in the office a certain number of days a week. It doesn’t have to be five. We can’t put the genie back in the bottle on remote work, but at the same time, we thought the world was going to be different when we were all online and it turns out we actually enjoyed seeing each other in person. We enjoy having dinner together. I don’t enjoy having dinner over Zoom with someone. I enjoy it when we’re breaking bread right next to each other. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Do you believe that you can please both sides? And that’s the hybrid model where people are going to work at the office two or three days a week and then you can work from home two or three days a week. Do you believe in that being effective or do you believe you have to pick a predominant one and focus? Because your operational back end, your company culture, your cadence, they’re all going to be determined by what you pick. And if you pick in the middle, you’re probably making trade-offs on both sides and maybe not getting the advantages because you don’t want to make trade-offs. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think it’s best if you take a stance, take a side. Hybrid. I would quibble with the \\[idea\\] that hybrid doesn’t work at all. I think you can be in person, you can be remote, you can be hybrid. You just need the systems around it to make up for the fact that you’re going to operate in this way. Every multinational corporation, when they have multiple locations, is doing some form of hybrid, right? You have some people who are in this office, some people in this \\[other\\] office, connected through telecommunications, and some people on the road. In any company that gets to a certain scale, the salespeople in the field are not actually at headquarters, and when you are having an all-hands meeting, those people call in. But when you have an important all-hands meeting, you call everybody in. You have an important offsite meeting; you call everybody in. There are certain things that should be done in person, and there are certain things that are okay to do over Zoom, over telecommunications, over email. I think that there’s a different medium to do different jobs, depending on the objective, and you should understand the drawbacks and the advantages of each one. At Sequoia, I mean, we take a lot of first meetings over Zoom. And during the pandemic when we were only doing meetings over Zoom, you just never got the right texture for the company, the cadence of how the company operated. And yeah, we might still take first meetings over Zoom, but we’re going to meet the team at some point in person. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Did you analyze your investing during that period, where you’re meeting more over Zoom versus more in person when it comes to approaching the investment decision? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah. We can make those assessments, but the hard part is that the environment is also different, right? So 2021 valuations were nutty. Was it the issue of making those investment decisions over Zoom, or was it the environments that drove valuations higher, so therefore the returns are going to be more difficult, more challenged when valuations are higher? ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Why do you play when the valuations are higher, when the game is loaded against you in a way? Why choose to keep playing? Why not back away and then come back when the odds are in your favor? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Well, historically, valuations have gone up. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  But if they keep going up, then how does that work? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think our LPs (limited partners) pay us to make money during good times and bad times. And here’s the thing that is most interesting to me: You can decide to shut down, but then you won’t get the texture of those companies being developed. And sometimes you’ve got to keep meeting companies, right? So you don’t shut things down. You can decide to invest fewer dollars when things are hot and you can decide to invest more dollars when things are cold, but the market is also smart. When things are hot, it’s usually because something new is happening. And if things are cold, maybe it’s just not a good time to invest, too. If you could identify when it’s irrationally exuberant, yes, you would decide not to invest in the irrationally exuberant situations. But in 1999, if you go back in history and look at megatrends in investing…  I’m 52 years old right now. When I was in junior high school, one of the things I did as a business was to build PCs, clone PCs, because the IBM PC/XT AT computers were really expensive. That was one megatrend, which was the PC revolution. Then there was the internet revolution, and then more recently, the cloud revolution, the mobile revolution. Right now we’re in the AI revolution. The internet revolution when I first started working professionally after college was the ad link exchange, and then we started investing in 1999. That’s when Venture Frogs started. And if you had decided not to invest in that time, you would’ve missed out on Google, Salesforce, PayPal, Zappos, OpenTable. There are a lot of great companies that were still founded during that time, and paying market prices for those investments would’ve been just fine. And you could wait until… ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Better than just fine. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  It would’ve been better than just fine, but you could wait until 2001 and maybe you could invest in lower valuations, but often in the public markets, you can wait because those companies are available when the multiples are low. In private companies, just because the valuations have come down, that doesn’t mean the company that you want to invest in is looking to raise a round \\[of funding\\]. Maybe in 1999, you wanted to invest in Google; in 2001 they happened to be public. You could invest in Google, but if they were private, maybe you wouldn’t be able to. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Yeah. John Bragg said this thing in my recent interview with him that I had never fully appreciated, I don’t think, which was that he had a reputation for overpaying for all of the land he was acquiring. And I said, “Why do you do that?” He said, “Well, if we’re easy to deal with, people want to deal with us.” And “These assets only go for sale once. So maybe it takes 12 years instead of 10 to get our payback, but it doesn’t really matter because there’s no opportunity 10 years from now to buy it again.” ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah. I think that’s an example for us. It’s the same as true investing in private companies. It’s still much better to pick the right company and slightly overpay than to invest in something that is cheap. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  You brought up AI as the next revolution. Where are we going with AI? Where do you see that? And obviously the longer we go out on the horizon, the harder it is to predict. So maybe let’s start with, What do you see as the next 12 months in AI and how do you envision 12 months to five years? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  It’s funny because I think in the history of technology changes—and I think Bill Gates said this—we almost always overestimate what things are going to happen in a year, and we underestimate what’s happened in 10 years. Yes, it’s harder to imagine 10 years out, but in the business I’m in at Sequoia, we are paid to make investments and to hold them long term. And we do have to sort of imagine 10 years out. I think in the next year, these foundation models are getting so good that you can see certain things being automated that we used to do that we’re not going to do as much. But I think the next step after that is that lots of people talk about customer service and how we can automate some of the customer service emails or calls and things like that. Okay, let’s say we do that. What’s next? Well, then you should reimagine the customer experience. AI will help us automate some of these things and there’ll be massive cost savings, but AI should also allow us to reinvent the customer experience. And that’s why we’re very excited about a company like Sierra. They’re not just going to help you automate customer service tickets; they’re going to help you reimagine what customer service looks like. Just similar to what happened with the internet; when the internet happened, we could book travel on the internet. We didn’t have to call a travel agent. It changed the experience. We could search. That changed the experience. It broadened. I had to imagine where I wanted to go and call someone to get me a ticket or to get a hotel. Now I can search. So my imagination could be broadened. And that just changed my experience of travel. And the airlines didn’t allow you to change tickets once you bought them because that was in some back-end system. They didn’t want to open up that system. Now we can change flights on the website. Well, the same will be true with AI. Start with automation, start with new experiences, and the experience will completely change over time, and it always takes a little longer. I mean, I remember that we talked about autonomous vehicles probably 10 years ago, and today we have autonomous vehicles working in a few cities with Waymo. People imagined that that would be solved very, very quickly.  But where are we going? I think we’re going in a world where many of the problems that we have in the past will get solved through automation. Many new problems will get solved through AI because it is going to be as good as we are in doing analysis and being creative and things like that. And so I think it’ll be a very, very productive megatrend. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  One way to explore this topic is to ask you what you’re looking to avoid with AI investments. And I’m thinking maybe something that comes to my mind is a wrapper over ChatGPT or something. What are you trying to avoid when it comes to making AI investments? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The wrapper is a good example. It’s just a different user interface on top of a foundation model, but I think we’re trying to make sure that something persists. And what if it persists? It has its unique distribution; it’s embedded into your workflow. It has true ROI (return on investment) for a long period of time, and it changes the experience. Other things I’d say we try to avoid are things that are roadkill along the way of a company like OpenAI or Google or Amazon or Meta. Small refinements into what the model doesn’t do well today are just going to be roadkill along the way.  And then I think we’re trying to avoid things that sound good, but they’re not good for businesses. Back to 1999: There were a lot of things that had lots of usage, but had no revenue. And right now there’s a different example, where there’s a lot of test revenue, but the churn is very high because people don’t stick. So there are a lot of things where you see very, very fast adoption, but the churn rate is very, very poor. So we’re trying to avoid those kinds of companies. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  \\[When it comes to\\] Google and Microsoft, how do you think you compete with them on a foundational model basis? A) They can scale into enterprise overnight. B) They can spend $100 billion. How do you think about that? Are we going to end up in a world where there are only a few foundational models and we’re all going to plug into them? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  To be honest, I don’t know, but I’ll tell you this. In the history of technology investing that I’ve been involved with, if you’re afraid of the incumbents, you should just punch out. In 1999, you could have been afraid for Microsoft because they had lots of money and lots of servers, and yet they didn’t win search. Someone else won search. Microsoft won the browser war for a hot socket. It was Netscape against Internet Explorer. I don’t know many people who use Internet Explorer today. Most people I know use Chrome. So this is not a static situation. I think you just have to sort of have an open mind on why you will win. And often, the reason why large companies don’t win is because they have their own internal issues that slow them down. So Microsoft, during the internet \\[revolution\\], there was the antitrust situation, and that slowed them down. They could no longer bundle IE into the operating system, so they had to break all those things apart. Google has its own regulatory challenges, and so does Microsoft, so I don’t presume that they’re all just going to win because they have a lot more money and they have lot more capital and they have a lot more people. And besides, if you thought that, then I would be out of a job. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  How important do you see what Facebook’s doing, then, where they’re spending $50 to 100 billion, but they’re making it open source? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think open source is a very, very important aspect of what has happened in technology. You have these religious fights between closed and open, and you have religious fights between Apple and Microsoft, or Apple and IBM. Let’s go back to “and.” The world is built on “and.” In the internet\\[’s early\\] days, there were lots of things that were built on open-source \\[code\\]. Some of it was closed source, and some of it was open source. And I think the same will be true with AI. There are going to be things where you just want to host it on a closed-source model because you know it has the breadth of functionality, and there are things where you can only make it work if you use your specific data and train it very specifically for you, and you’re going to use open-source models for that. And just like Google built a great business, which is pretty closed source, on open-source software like Linux, I think the world of AI is going to be “and” as well. There’ll be closed source, and there’ll be open source. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  I want you to imagine that you’re in charge of Canada and the US and maybe the UK, and I tell you that we are optimizing to be the best in the world at AI. What are the policies that you think about? How do you approach this problem, and how do you encourage us to be the world leaders? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I’m maybe overly optimistic about human nature, so I believe that you want to have as little regulation as possible in the early days. Let people experiment; let people try things. Is it all going to be good? No, but if we had overregulated the internet, it would not have grown to the scale that it is today. Do we have problems on the internet? Absolutely. So I believe in having regulation that is more open than not, and then slowly closing off things that you know are not good or the behavior that is not good. Regulators often worry about the fact that if you wait too long, you won’t be able to regulate it. I don’t know if I believe that. Then on the flip side, I don’t know of a time that has ever worked to fight against technology and to overregulate technology. You could have overregulated the fact that the scribes were going to no longer have jobs because we came up with the printing press. You can go all the way back in time like that. Or figuring out how to have a plow so that you need fewer people to sow seeds, because the plow can do the work of three or four people, all the way up to a tractor. How have we done when trying to regulate, or overregulate or control, things that sort of make human beings much more productive? That’s what we’re talking about with technology; that’s what we’re talking about with AI. And then if you want to start applying regulation, there’s maybe a slightly different framework that I would use, which is, as an example, the combustion engine. Nobody regulated the engine. We regulated which engines can go on the streets, what can go into a plane. We regulated how it was applied. But in a lab, people were doing research and trying to make the combustion engine even more powerful, more fuel efficient. You don’t regulate that. You regulate it when it gets into the hands of a consumer. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  So that was like removing barriers, almost. But what about amplifying? What about the push? How do we encourage more? How would you embrace this as a country? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The market is pretty good at pushing. When they see opportunity, more and more capital goes into it, and more people go to school to \\[learn how to use it\\]. In almost every single technology revolution I’ve been part of, there are too few people who understand that technology. When it was the PC industry, there were some people who understood mainframes, and very few people who understood PCs. More and more people, more and more investment went into PCs, more and more people bought PCs, more people started using PCs, and more people started building applications for PCs. So over time, there were just a lot more people and a lot more investment in them. People went to school to write software specifically for the PC, as opposed to the mainframe. That happened with the internet. Most people didn’t know how to build a website. More and more people learned how to program in HTML and Python and Linux, and learn how to use Linux to build today. And that happened with cloud and mobile. So today we have probably too few people who really, really understand the technology and its application. But you have so many people going into it today because they see that the future is going to be powered by AI, so wait a year or two. There’s plenty of push today. That’s why the valuations are high for AI companies. And wait a year or two; there are going to be a lot of things that are going to be built. In fact, the hot take is that many things will be overbuilt. So maybe we are building too many GPUs (graphics processing units) for a year or two years out; maybe there are too many data centers that have GPUs a year or two years out. And maybe those things will get cheap, and we’ll find new applications when \\[the technology\\] gets really, really cheap. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  That would be sort of the history of the market. Actually, it’s interesting that you brought up “Don’t fight technology.” There’s a saying in investing: “Don’t fight the Fed.” It’s sort of the same sort of…  ",
  "Alfred Lin:  The Fed is way more powerful, in many respects. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Than technology? No. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Well, I think the Fed can constrain or can loosen money supply in a very dramatic way, so it applies throughout the whole economy, as opposed to just technology. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Historically, businesses have cycles. We tend to overbuild when we’re optimistic, and then you go through that phase you just talked about. Out of the large technology companies today, who do you think is best positioned? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  That’s hard. Well, if you want to use “Don’t fight the tape,” when I started my technology career, Microsoft was the largest technology company, and today they’re the largest company. They seem to have figured out, through their ups and downs, how to stay relevant and stay on top. I think Google’s having some challenges with their own regulatory issues. And Apple—don’t ever count Apple out. They weren’t the first to come up with the PC. They weren’t first to come up with the mobile phone. There were so many other mobile phones. They just wait until they can create a great customer experience. And then when they do, they pounce. They weren’t the first to come up with an MP3 player. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Or a phone. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Or a phone. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  How do you think of Nvidia? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Well, I think Nvidia is a very great company for a variety of reasons. One of which is, it went from a graphics processing company to being the way we power all of AI. And they fought for so long about this idea of parallel processing, where the CPU (central processing unit) worked a certain way and the GPU worked a different way, and the GPU is now shown to be more powerful after we sort of got to the edge of Moore’s Law. The GPU is winning out because it can process things much more efficiently. But I worry about the fact that they’ve only had one leader in their whole cycle. I worry about what happens when Jensen Huang decides not to be the head of Nvidia. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Yeah, that is the question, I guess. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think that’s the question a lot of people have. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Jensen’s a remarkable CEO. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Jensen’s a remarkable CEO, and he does things very differently than anybody else. We had him speak at our base camp, which is our annual retreat for our founders, and he just came out with so many great stories about Nvidia, about his personal life, and also about his management style that is so different. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  I remember being there, and that was awesome. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  You’ve said in the past that sometimes the path to greater efficiency is doing things sequentially, and sometimes it’s doing them in parallel. Can you explain that? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Well, I think most people are trained to do things in serial. They take a problem, they break it down into pieces, and they do one piece at a time. Step number one, problem number one, solve problem number two, because we need the solutions to problem number one to feed into problem number two. And they eventually go down the path. And if you’re an individual contributor, you write code, you just keep writing the code, and you finish the code and you submit it. But if you’re managing a team, you need to break down this piece of software into components so that you can give it to your team members, and you can have all 10 of them working on it. If you write it yourself, even if you’re a really good software writer, you literally have to be a 10X engineer on top of your 10X engineers, so you have to be a 100X engineer to do it in the same timeframe that 10 10X engineers can do it. Sometimes it’s just more efficient to break the problem down so that you can put them in parallel and then stick them all together. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  How do you think about companies and time span, and specifically maybe with an angle towards positioning yourself to rapidly adapt to whatever the future brings, versus trying to predict the future and running ahead of it? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I think the consensus would tell you that it’s very, very hard to predict the future. And your ability to predict the future is uneven because in the world that you know, you may be able to be very good at predicting the future. But the world is not stationary, and the world changes. And in this new world, trying to predict the future when you don’t have many facts or many patterns that you can go against, it’s much better to have a machine that knows when to pounce than to try to predict what’s going to happen. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Go deeper on that. A machine. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Well, your company is in some sense a machine, so you’re trying to figure out when you should pounce on an opportunity. You’re building, you’re building, you’re building, and you decide, “I’m going to take this path now,” and you’re going to make your company go in this direction because you see the opportunity in this path. Maybe make the example more concrete. Perhaps as an example, DoorDash started with food delivery, but specifically restaurant delivery. And they waited until they figured out an advantage that they could have in grocery \\[delivery\\]. But the mechanisms by which to deliver restaurant food and grocery food were pretty much the same. And figuring out when to enter the grocery market had a lot to do with whether the company was ready, the customers were ready, the market was ready, and the groceries were ready. You can predict that customers want this before they want it, or you can just wait until you see lots of customers banging on the door, writing to DoorDash, “Hey, can you also get my groceries?” It’s a matter of, Do you want to be pushing the customer to do what you want, or do you want the customer to pull you in the direction that they want to go? ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Is the biggest risk there that you try to tackle two problems at once? I’m assuming they knew they wanted to get into groceries, so part of the risk at the start is, “If we’re focusing on restaurants and groceries, all the time we’re spending on one of those two things, not all of it, but a lot of it’s coming at the expense of the other.” Or do you see that as, “No, it’s not”? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  It’s a very sharp insight that you have. I think the one thing that you’ll find is that there are lots of examples that I could use to support your conclusion there, because before DoorDash happened, there were plenty of other solutions. Most notably, there was Grubhub. That was just the website; they passed the order to the restaurant, and the restaurant delivered. And Tony’s observation was, “That’s not deep enough of a solution.” Why was it not deep enough? Well, there are a lot of restaurants out there that don’t have their own delivery staff. And why don’t we just… ",
  "Shane Parrish:  You’re creating problems for them in a way. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Exactly. The only restaurants that would be on Grubhub’s website would be all the companies that already had delivery staff available. So what DoorDash did was to expand the market, and by expanding the market, they were very focused on that problem. \\[Restaurant owners\\] were like, “Really? You’ll take the order, I cook it, and you’ll deliver it for me? I’ve never heard this before.” So you were just educating the market for a period of time because you’re just focused on that problem. Besides Grubhub, which didn’t do that, there was Postmates. Originally, Postmates wasn’t just in restaurant delivery. They were doing anything, they would pick up from anywhere, and they would deliver it to anywhere. And they would even pick up something from, I don’t know, Bloomingdale’s or from Walmart. But in that example, there were just too many different things that you could do, and it wasn’t focused. And even more broadly than that, there was Taskrabbit, where you can run errands. Well, one of the errands you can have them run, someone who is on Taskrabbit, is to go pick up food from any restaurant. So simplicity of the solution is the reason why I think you want to start with a very focused problem. It’s much easier to tell people, “This is what DoorDash does,” and then over time you expand that. You expand the remit because you’ve earned the trust of the customer to allow you to do more things. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  One of the problems, when you were saying that, is, How did DoorDash find drivers in those early days? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah, it was hard. If you believed that it was more profitable to transport humans than to deliver food, then you would come to the conclusion that Uber and Lyft would get all the drivers, and DoorDash would not get any of their drivers. And it turned out that, well, there are some people who would prefer to deliver food or a package than to deliver people. They didn’t want to have to have social interactions. And there are people with perfectly fine cars, but they’re not perfectly fine cars to transport humans in. So early on, we thought it was going to be a problem, but it was less of a problem than we had originally imagined. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  One of the problems that I anticipate, or maybe from the outside looking in, and I can be completely wrong, is that when you sign up a grocery store customer, they want to work with you in a particular way. But it might not be a standardized way. And then you might say yes because you want to sign up that customer. Maybe it’s like Albertsons or something. But then you go to the next largest grocery store chain, and they want to work with you in a different way. How do you think through the standardization, which is like, “No, we work in this way,” versus creating all of these one-offs? I see a lot of startups do this, where they want to sign a customer, so they’ll violate their standard procedures and they’ll create these one-off contracts and technical solutions, and they’re trying to get revenue so that they can still exist. How do you think about that trade-off? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I use the accordion example often, which is, you pull the accordion too far and then you have to push it back in. At some level, if you are super rigid, you’re not going to win your first few customers. So at the very beginning, the accordion is completely folded, and you do pull the accordion and you allow things that you may not want to allow in those very early days. And then it gets stretched super far, and you’re like, “Oh, shoot. I need to standardize a bunch of things.” Then, first, you’re not going to go back on these customers or merchants, so you’re going to go into the next inning with a lot more standardization. Or you break up your hundred customers into three personas or four personas and try to have four different standardizations. But trying to be overly standardized at the beginning is generally not a great idea.  The opposite of that is to have a standardized product and then allow customization on the edges. I think a lot of software companies are trying to do that. “We build a platform. The platform is not changing. You’re buying the platform. But on the edges we allow for customization.” At the beginning, you find other developers who are willing to do the professional services on the side, and go from there. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  It’s almost like you earn the right to do standardization, when you’re trying to be the back end, where you have to accommodate at the start and widen the accordion. And then as you get scale and network effects, and more and more benefits to the merchant or partner that you’re partnering with, you can  standardize more. Is that true? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  That is true. I also just think there’s a lot of hubris in thinking that you can standardize at the beginning, when you don’t even know whether that’s the right solution for everyone to standardize on. So bring in some customers.  They’ll tell you your standardization doesn’t work—not only because it doesn’t work for them; it may be that it doesn’t work for many people—and at least learn from that. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  What’s the difference between working backwards and working forwards? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Working backwards is this idea that Amazon popularized, which was, you start with the vision of the world that you want to imagine. You think about, “If everything goes right, what is the world that we live in, and what does this product become” that you’re trying to build? At Sequoia, we call that the “pre-parade.” If everything goes right with this company, what does it become? And then you work backwards from there. One year before that, what does it look like? Two years before that, what does it look like? Amazon popularized working backwards, meaning that you go from the future all the way to today. And I love that concept in a sense, but I’ve also seen lots of founders struggle to take it from the future, where they have this great vision of the world, and really map it all the way back to today. They map it somewhere 5 years out, 10 years out, but they can’t map it to today. I also tell founders, “Okay, that’s the future that you’re aiming for. Here are the realities of today. What does it look like one year ahead, two years ahead, three years ahead?” That’s working forwards, and if the two don’t match, probably you’re not on the same trajectory. I believe in having founders work both backwards and forwards. Often, when you work backwards and you think you have a great plan, and then you mis-execute and you don’t know that you’re not executing, it’s because you haven’t worked forwards on what year one, two, and three look like on that trajectory. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  What are the two or three mental models you keep coming back to most when you’re making a decision? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I’m going to ask you that question. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  This is your interview. Nobody’s here to listen to me. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I want to know what two or three mental models you use. I think the one that I learned from Amazon is \\[to identify\\] whether this is a Type 1 or Type 2 decision. If it’s a Type 1 decision, I’ve learned from Brian Chesky to run out the clock because you can’t go back. For a Type 2 decision, you just move forward, make a call, and course-correct along the way. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Type 1 being irreversible, and Type 2, yeah. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah, irreversible. So if it’s irreversible, run out the clock. Meaning, get all the information; make sure that that’s a high-confidence decision. With Type 2, if you can always change it, make a fast decision and keep iterating. That’s one model. The other mental model I think about is working backwards and working forwards. Top down versus bottom up is a similar sort of idea. Some problems are better solved thinking top down; some problems are more easily solved just working bottom up. Another one, generally, is to break up hard problems into smaller and smaller bite-sized problems and solve each of those individually. And just the way I live my life, this is not a mental model. It’s a lot about consistent compounding, and just building every single day, doing the little things that sort of improve myself or oneself or the company that I’m working with. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Talk to me about how you think through the breaking problems thing, because you mentioned breaking it into smaller problems, solving those, and then you get the solution. How do you think of that versus the individual, optimal solution for that particular sub-problem, which might not lead to the optimal solution for the bigger problem? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  Yeah, so I think there is local optimization and global optimization; that’s what you’re talking about here. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  That’s a much better way to word it. ",
  "Alfred Lin:  If you want to solve a global optimization problem, you need to pop up, and if you’re trying to solve a local optimization problem, you want to go down. So I think the problem, first and foremost, has to be at the right altitude, and then you can break the problem down from there. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  Is there an example that comes to mind for your thinking? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  If you’re trying to climb a mountain, the top-down problem is, What’s the path? Even before you climb the mountain, you’re going to plot the path. But once you’re on the mountain and you have a path, you’re just going one step in front of the other on that path. If you find that the path is not right, hopefully you’ve had some backup paths, and backup plans, so that you can go one foot in front of the other. “Path A doesn’t work? Well, Path B might be a little better, because I plotted the alternative path.” So that’s an example of planning top down, on your path and your alternatives, and doing a bunch of scenario analysis. And then when you’re executing in a day-to-day period, you literally just go execute. I don’t see that any differently than a company. You have a plan for the year, you have some scenario planning around it, and the more scenario plans you have, the more easily you can course-correct. You’re supposed to be on Path A; you decide that you’re still going on Path A. You’re slightly off; let’s go back on Path A. Path A turns out not to be the right thing. We’re going to pick Path B because that’s the second alternative, but then we’re going to go right, one foot in front of the other, \\[along\\] Path B. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  We always end these interviews with the same question, which is, What is success for you? ",
  "Alfred Lin:  I knew that this question was coming, and to me, success is just the process and having a good process. Because if you have a process that’s consistent to who you are and your values, and you live that every single day, and you get up every day and follow through on that process, you’re already successful. Lots of people talk about, “Success is not the destination; it’s the journey.” I think it’s just the process before the journey. Which direction are you going to go? Why did you decide to go in that direction? How fast do you want to go in that direction? Before you can go on that journey, hopefully you’ve planned things out and you have had a process to sort of plan that out. And if you did that right, you know you’re going to be successful. ",
  "Shane Parrish:  All right, time for my reflections on that interview. At a high level, I think that was one of the best interviews I’ve ever been a part of. His answers were on point. I felt like my questions were actually pretty good, which I normally don’t feel good about in hindsight. And I thought his stories were just so incredible. And I think going back to the beginning, where he liked to hack things together—how many founders do we hear this story from? It’s not a disdain for authority as much as questioning authority. You don’t get authority because you’re an authority figure. I get to figure things out my way. I’m going to try to find a better way to do things. And he talked about elementary school, \\[where\\] he just tried to hack his way through things. He got suspended a few times, like the slide and the stairs. And then we all have this one teacher, and he had Ms. Einstein, I think, and she had this way of teaching where she would put up a problem and then he would try to solve the problem and he would always do it in the quickest way possible. And I remember he made that bet with her that if he knew the answer, then he wouldn’t have to do the homework. And she let him get away with that once or twice, but then she sat him down, and I thought that was just fascinating. \\[She said,\\] “You’re very smart. I’ve seen a lot of people waste their talents. So what do you want to do? Do you want to start first or do you want to finish first?” And he retorted, “Well, I’d like to start first and finish first with the least amount of work possible.” And this is the answer my kids have always said: “Well, I just want to do the least amount of work possible to get it done. Check the box.” And then this is where it gets profound. She said to him, “That’s a great answer for a sixth-grader, but what happens in life is there’s no finish line? What are you going to do then?” And I think that question is so powerful. I’m going to take that one back to my kids and challenge them when they say something like that.  One of the other things he said that I thought was really interesting was, “Focus on the inputs,” right? You can’t always control the outputs, but you can control the inputs, and that is the process by which you go about \\[getting\\] the outputs. I think we talked about workouts. I work out every day. He works out every day, and you just do the work every day. And he had the same philosophy. What did he say? “You just get up every single day and do the things that are important.” So the inputs that he has are that he gets up every morning, he works out, he reads through his email, and he tries to think about “What is the most important thing to do that day?” and then focuses on that. I think that is a recipe for success, but often… Oh wait, let me rephrase this.  We talked about the difference between applying force and removing barriers, and I thought his quip about, “Sometimes you can’t find the obstacle unless you apply the force” was really on point. I had never heard that talked about before. That nuance was new to me. I loved it. It made a lot of sense to me.  When we were talking about staff turnover, I liked the notion of regrettable turnover versus unregrettable turnover, and that’s just a polite way of saying, “Hey, we had the wrong fit. We don’t mind this turnover.” And I think that classifying things in terms of that would be really important internally. You can use that to gauge, Do we have the right kind of turnover? Because everybody just talks about these turnover metrics, but a lot of times you’re losing the right people. We talked about hiring and how you should hire somebody who’s one or two chapters ahead instead of 10 chapters ahead. We talked about considering the support networks around those people and how they contributed to their success. I like to think of this, and I don’t even know where I got this idea, but it’s sort of like you want to talk to somebody who’s just done the thing that you need them to do, so that maximizes the odds that the thing that they’ve done was done in an environment in a similar situation that could work again. If they did this thing 10 or 20 years ago, odds are they’re not going to be able to do it again.  And I think about this with mentors. You want your mentor to basically be your boss or maybe one step ahead of your boss, but you don’t want your mentor to be two or three levels up in an organization where they’re older. You want to go to those people for perspective. But when it comes to actual skills, like tangible skills that you need to succeed at your job, you want to go to your colleagues, you want to go to your boss, you want to go to people closest to the problem. When it comes to perspective, you might want to go to people who are closer to the end of the maze than the beginning because they’re going to be able to tell you what matters from what doesn’t in a way that is really hard to do when you’re young. I thought the notion of \\[Zappos’\\] best customers returning their shoes the most was really counterintuitive and quite profound. And I think that sticks out to me. Most people would maximize for avoiding returns, but when they looked at it, their best customers actually return the most shoes. And then they designed their business around that, which I thought was really clever.  I like asking people the same question, so I asked him, Is there an ideal growth rate? And I asked John Mackey the exact same thing, and they had very similar but sort of different answers. And I think Alfred’s answer was a bit more nuanced. The answer depends. If you’re growing so fast that the customer experience starts to degrade, you’re hurting yourself, so yeah, that’s too fast. And if you’re losing customers because you’re not servicing them, that’s too fast. But otherwise, you want a lot of velocity. You want to move fast, you want to move quick, you want to keep going. I think we talked a lot about decision making in organizations. We talked about the process. Instead of making fast, good decisions, the thing that people value is having a good process that slows you down. The problem with process in organizations is that it becomes a crutch. The mentality inside the organization is “I will not get fired for following the process, even if that process results in a completely ludicrous result.” You flip your hands up and you say, “I just followed the process.” I used to hate working with people who did this. It drove me absolutely insane. And I used to retort, and I would get in trouble for this, “Look, if you’re just going to follow the process, you might as well go work at McDonald’s and you should probably get minimum wage.” And what I meant by that was “Why are we paying you $100,000 a year or more if you can’t opt out of the process?” If you can’t use judgment to know that this result is not favorable to what we’re trying to do, then what are you doing here? And I think that too many people use process as a crutch, and you have to call that out. You have to call that out. You need to be able to make high-quality, quick decisions, and the process is there to help you, but that’s it. It’s just there to help you.  Think about a big continuum. On the left, you have low cost of failure, and on the right, you have high cost of failure, and the speed and pace and information you need in this continuum change. So when the cost of failure is low, you want to move as fast as possible. The biggest risk is that you take your time and when the cost of failure is high, the biggest risk is that you make a mistake; you go too quick. So there’s a continuum there. A lot of organizations use pretty much the same decision process for both ends of that spectrum. And that is completely wrong, and it slows you down and it makes you susceptible to a lot of competition.  We talked a little bit about the difference between founder mode and professional manager mode. I liked his analogy about fire and ice, and he said the best companies have both this huge fire \\[and this icy side\\]. The fire is the entrepreneur, the spirit. They run hot and it’s compelling, it’s interesting, it’s mission-focused, it’s driven. It causes you to move faster than you otherwise would. And the icy side is that idealistic, cold, professional management. And you have these two forces that are in harmony with each other. And I didn’t say balance; I said harmony. And I think that distinction is very clear. You don’t want 50-50. Sometimes you’re going to need more founder mode and sometimes you’re going to need more managerial mode. And those two things are different depending on what’s going on when you talk about a crisis.  We had some of those examples from Airbnb and DoorDash, and he went into detail with those. I thought those were super powerful. In those situations when there’s a crisis, you want to be more in founder mode. And when maybe it’s status quo, day to day, you want to be more in managerial mode.  I thought the idea of crucible moments was really interesting. I thought talking about first principles was really interesting, too. And for me, \\[using\\] first principles is one of the best ways to discover new solutions. The way that I write about this and the great mental models is sort of like if you had a house made of Lego blocks, you know it’s possible to make a house. And that’s what we’re often starting with. And we often just think about the first layer. So you might move a few blocks around and the house basically looks the same, but you can disassemble that whole thing and build something completely different. You can build a car; you can build a house; you can build a skyscraper because all the pieces are there to do that. And I think that while you can take first-principles thinking down to an atomic level, and this is often where these discussions go with people when you start talking about first principles, you don’t need to \\[do that\\] to get the value out of it. The value is gained simply by going a level or two deeper than most people do. Solutions are based on what you see. This is like human psychology. We think that what we see is all there is to see. That’s our perspective, our relativity around the situation. The best way to change that is to change your perspective, but different answers reveal themselves at different levels. Going from 30,000 feet to 20,000 feet, you’re going to have a different aperture in the problem. Going from 20,000 feet to 10 feet, you’re going to have a much different aperture in the problem. Whenever you’re stuck, try to change the level at which you’re viewing the problem. Think about it as a microscope. You’re going to switch the lens. You’re going to go deeper. And sometimes if you’re really in the weeds, you want to take a step back. You want to zoom out a little bit. And I think that more people would get value from that if they thought about first principles that way instead of dismissing it, because the instinct is, “Oh, I can’t think at the atom level, so I’m not going to think in first principles.” And I think we miss a lot of superpowers by doing that. We talked about work. Let me rephrase this. We talked about working from home or working in the office. I thought it was interesting that he said, “You should take a stance. You shouldn’t be both. You shouldn’t be hybrid.” I thought that that was really interesting. I think it’s true as well. Anecdotally for myself, I believe that. And I also think that it’s really hard to build an early-stage company and company culture remotely. It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but it’s definitely difficult. There are definitely counter examples, Shopify being one, but they did start in person and then they went remote. And Automattic, which is their chief competitor in a lot of ways with WooCommerce, started remote, and they’ve been remote by default. And I think that those two are more exceptions than the norm. I think a lot is lost by working from home. I don’t want to pick fights with anybody. That’s just my personal thinking. I see a lot of people doing calls in saunas, at the grocery store, and all these work moments \\[in various places\\]. And I don’t know; it’s interesting to me. I think people are much more engaged and they feel like part of something larger than themselves when they go into the office. And I think it’s really important that we are exposed to different people. The world often tends to look like you when you work remotely. You close your laptop at the end of the day; you hang out with friends who make very similar amounts of money to you. They vote similar to you; they think similar to you. And the world just starts to look a lot like you. And you forget. Going back to perspective, right? You forget. You don’t have to deal with that crazy person in the office who might be a liberal or a Republican, or you forget about the different socioeconomic statuses that you came in contact with, and you forget the compassion and empathy you had for everybody in society who’s struggling and just trying to put food on their table for their family. And you get that by walking by that homeless person. You get that by going into these shops and \\[seeing\\] these kids who are working there and these adults who are working there, and they’re struggling and maybe they’re down on their luck. And I think that we lose sight of that sometimes. When we work from home, we order to our house. The world just tends to look like us. I thought we hit on the famous Buffett maxim \\[(“Don’t fight the Fed”)\\]. I’m going to wrap this up soon because I could keep going. This podcast was full of amazing insights, but we did hit on the idea that it’s better to overpay for a great business than underpay for a mediocre business. And that’s the Buffett lesson of investing.  All in all, I love this podcast. Alfred’s one of my favorite people. I think we could definitely continue the conversation for another six or seven hours. There are so many takeaways from this. I hope you share it with your friends. I hope you listen to it, and I hope you loved it as much as I did. Until next time."
